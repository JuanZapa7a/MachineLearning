    "# Lesson 06 Functional Programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a fantastic programming language. It is likely to be your first choice\n",
    "for developing a machine learning or data science application. Python is\n",
    "interesting because it is a multi-paradigm programming language that can be used\n",
    "for both object-oriented and imperative programming. It has a simple syntax that\n",
    "is easy to read and comprehend.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science and mathematics, the solution of many problems can be more\n",
    "easily and naturally expressed using the functional programming style. In this\n",
    "tutorial, we’ll discuss Python’s support for the functional programming paradigm\n",
    "and Python’s classes and modules that help you program in this style.\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this tutorial, you will know:\n",
    "\n",
    "*    Basic idea of functional programming\n",
    "*    The `itertools` library\n",

    "## Tutorial Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is divided into five parts; they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.    The idea of functional programming\n",
    "2.    High order functions: Filter, map, and reduce\n",

    "### The idea of functional programming\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have programming experience, you likely learned imperative programming.\n",
    "It is built with statements and manipulating variables. Functional programming\n",
    "is a declarative paradigm. It is different from the imperative paradigm that\n",
    "programs are built in by applying and composing functions. The functions here\n",
    "are supposed to be closer to the definition of a mathematical function, in which\n",
    "there are no side effects or simply no access to external variables. When you\n",
    "call them with the same argument, they always give you the same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of functional programming is to make your program less error-prone.\n",
    "Without the side effects, it is more predictable and easier to see the outcome.\n",
    "We also do not need to worry about one part of the program interfering with\n",
    "another part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many libraries adopted a functional programming paradigm. For example, the\n",
