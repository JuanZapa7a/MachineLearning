    "How to Learn Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to learn a language, whether for natural languages like\n",
    "English or programming language like Python. Babies learn a language from\n",
    "listening and mimicking. Slowly, when they learn the pattern and some\n",
    "vocabulary, they can make up their own sentences. On the contrary, when college\n",
    "students learn Latin,  they probably start with grammar rules—singular and\n",
    "plural, indicative and subjunctive, nominative and accusative. Then they can\n",
    "build up to forming a sentence in Latin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, when learning Python or any programming language, you can either read\n",
    "other people’s code, try to understand, and then modify from it. Or you can\n",
    "learn the language rules and build up a program from scratch. The latter would\n",
    "be beneficial if your ultimate goal is to work on the language, such as writing\n",
    "the Python interpreter. But usually, the former approach is faster to get some\n",

    "This Python code is implementing the secant method to find a root for a\n",
    "function. If you are new to Python, you should look at the example and see how\n",
    "much you can understand. If you have prior knowledge from other programming\n",
    "languages, you would probably guess `def` defines a function. But if you do not,\n",
    "you might feel confused. If this is the case, it is best for you to start from a\n",
    "beginner’s book on programming to learn about the concept of functions,\n",
    "variables, loops, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing you might think you can do is modify the functions. For example,\n",
    "what if we are not using the secant method to find the root but instead use\n",
    "Newton’s method? You might guess how to modify the equation on line 4 to do it.\n",
    "What about the bisection method? You would need to add a statement of `if\n",
    "f(x2)>0` to decide which way we should go. If we look at the function\n",
    "`f_example`, we see the symbol **. This is the exponent operator to mean `x` to\n",

    "the idiomatic way of coding, and do some work even if you cannot explain it in\n",
    "detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to learn Python, it is inevitable you will want to learn from a\n",
    "book. Just picking up any beginner’s book on Python from your local library\n",
    "should work. But when you read, keep the bigger picture of your learning goal in\n",
    "mind. Do some exercises while you read, try out the codes from the book, and\n",
    "make up your own. It is not a bad idea to skip some pages. Reading a book cover\n",
    "to cover may not be the most efficient way to learn. You should prevent yourself\n",
    "from drilling too deep into a single topic because this will make you lose track\n",
    "of the bigger goal of using Python to do useful things. Topics such as\n",
    "multithreading, network sockets, and object-oriented programming can be treated\n",
    "as advanced topics for later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a language that is decoupled from its interpreter or compiler.\n",
    "Therefore, different interpreters may behave a bit differently. The standard\n",
    "interpreter from python.org is `CPython`, also called the reference\n",
    "implementation. A common alternative is `PyPy`. Regardless of which one you use,\n",
    "you should learn with Python 3 rather than Python 2 as the latter is an obsolete\n",
    "dialect. But bear in mind that Python gained its momentum with Python 2, and you\n",
    "may still see quite a lot of Python 2 programming around.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "If you cannot go to the library to pick up a printed book, you can make use of\n",
    "some online resources instead. I would highly recommend beginners read The\n",
    "[Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). It is short\n",
    "but guides you through different aspects of the language. It lets you take a\n",
    "peek at what Python can do and how to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the tutorial, you probably should keep the [Python Language\n",
    "Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html) and the [Python\n",
    "Library Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) handy. You will\n",
    "reference them from time to time to check the syntax and lookup function usages.\n",
    "Do not force yourself to remember every function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is built-in in macOS, but you may want to install a newer version. In\n",
    "Windows, it is common to see people using Anaconda instead of installing just\n",
    "the Python interpreter. But if you feel it is too much hassle to install an IDE\n",
    "and the Python programming environment, you might consider using [Google\n",
    "Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?authuser=1).  This allows you to write\n",
    "Python programs in a “notebook” format. Indeed, many machine learning projects\n",
    "are developed in the Jupyter notebook as it allows us to quickly explore\n",
    "different approaches to a problem and visually verify the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use an online shell at https://www.python.org/shell/ to try out a\n",
    "short snippet. The downside compared to the Google Colab is that you cannot save\n",
    "your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asking for Help\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start from an example you saw from a book and modify it, you might\n",
    "break the code, making it fail to run. It is especially true in machine learning\n",
    "examples, where you have many lines of code that cover data collection,\n",
    "preprocessing, building a model, training, validation, prediction, and finally\n",
    "presenting the result in a visualized manner. When you see an error result from\n",
    "your code, the first thing you need to do is pinpoint the few lines that caused\n",
    "the error. Try to check the output from each step to make sure it is in the\n",
    "correct format. Or try to roll back your code to see which change you made\n",
    "started to introduce errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to make mistakes and learn from mistakes. When you try out\n",
    "syntax and learn this way, you should encounter error messages from time to\n",
    "time. If you try to make sense from it, then it will be easier to figure out\n",
    "what caused the error. Almost always, if the error comes from a library that\n",
    "you’re using, double confirm your syntax with the library’s documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are still confused, try to search for it on the internet. If you’re using\n",
    "Google, one trick you can use is to put the entire error message in a pair of\n",
    "double quotes when you search. Or sometimes, searching  on StackOverflow might\n",
    "give you better answers.\n",
