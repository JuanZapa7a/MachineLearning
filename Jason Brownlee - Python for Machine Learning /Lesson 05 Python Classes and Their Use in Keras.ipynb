    "\n",
    "## Defining a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The class keyword allows for the creation of a new class definition, immediately\n",
    "followed by the class name:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    <statements>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this manner, a new class object bound to the specified class name\n",
    "(**MyClass**, in this case) is created. Each class object can support\n",
    "instantiation and attribute references, as we will see shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instantiation and Attribute References\n",
    "\n",
    "Instantiation is the creation of a new instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new instance of a class, we can call it using its class name and\n",
    "assign it to a variable. This will create a new, empty class object:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = MyClass()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon creating a new instance of a class, Python calls its object constructor\n",
    "method, `__init()__`, which often takes arguments that are used to set the\n",
    "instantiated object’s attributes.\n",

    "## Class Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Another feature that Python supports is class **inheritance**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a subclass (also known as a derived or child class) to access all attributes and methods of a superclass (also known as a base or parent class). \n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for using a subclass is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class SubClass(BaseClass):\n",
    "    <statements>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible that a subclass inherits from multiple base classes, too. In\n",
    "this case, the syntax would be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class SubClass(BaseClass1, BaseClass2, BaseClass3):\n",
    "    <statements>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Class attributes and methods are searched for in the base class and also in\n",
    "subsequent base classes in the case of multiple inheritances. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python further allows a method in a subclass to override another method in the\n",
    "base class that carries the same name. An overriding method in the subclass may\n",
    "be replacing the base class method or simply extending its capabilities. When an\n",
    "overriding subclass method is available, it is this method that is executed when\n",
    "called, rather than the method with the same name in the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Classes in Keras\n",
    "\n",
    "A practical use of classes in Keras is to write one’s own callbacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "A callback is a powerful tool in Keras that allows us to look at our model’s\n",
    "behavior during the different stages of training, testing, and prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, we may pass a list of callbacks to any of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "*    `keras.Model.fit()`\n",
    "*    `keras.Model.evaluate()`\n",
    "*    `keras.Model.predict()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The Keras API comes with several built-in callbacks. Nonetheless, we might wish\n",
    "to write our own, and for this purpose, we shall look at how to build a custom\n",
    "callback class. In order to do so, we can inherit several methods from the\n",
    "callback base class, which can provide us with information of when:\n",
    "\n",
    "*    Training, testing, and prediction starts and ends\n",
    "*    An epoch starts and ends\n",
    "*    A training, testing, and prediction batch starts and ends\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s first consider a simple example of a custom callback that reports back\n",
    "every time that an epoch starts and ends. We will name this custom callback\n",
    "class, `EpochCallback`, and override the epoch-level methods, `on_epoch_begin()`\n",
    "and `on_epoch_end()`, from the base class, `keras.callbacks.Callback`:"
